Neptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases. As one of the gas giants, Neptune's atmospheric composition is distinct from that of terrestrial planets like Earth. Here's an approximate breakdown of the percentages of the main gases in Neptune's atmosphere:

1. Hydrogen (H2): Approximately 80%
2. Helium (He): Approximately 19%
3. Methane (CH4): Trace amounts (around 1.5%)
4. Hydrogen Deuteride (HD): Trace amounts (smaller than 0.015%)
5. Ethane (C2H6): Trace amounts (smaller than 0.0025%)

Neptune's atmosphere is characterized by its blue color, which is primarily attributed to the presence of methane gas. The high percentages of hydrogen and helium, along with the trace amounts of other gases, contribute to Neptune's unique characteristics and dynamic weather patterns.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on different regions within Neptune's atmosphere.
