Venus has a thick and largely inhospitable atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of other gases. Here's a rough approximation of the percentages of the main gases in Venus' atmosphere:

1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Approximately 96.5%
2. Nitrogen (N2): Approximately 3.5%
3. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Trace amounts

The high concentration of carbon dioxide in Venus' atmosphere contributes to its extreme greenhouse effect, resulting in surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The presence of sulfur dioxide also plays a role in the planet's atmospheric and surface conditions.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on location and altitude within Venus' atmosphere.
