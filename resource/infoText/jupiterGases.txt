Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases. Due to its nature as a gas giant, Jupiter's atmospheric composition is different from that of terrestrial planets like Earth. Here's a rough approximation of the percentages of the main gases in Jupiter's atmosphere

1. Hydrogen (H2) Approximately 89.8%
2. Helium (He) Approximately 10.2%
3. Methane (CH4) Trace amounts (around 0.3%)
4. Ammonia (NH3) Trace amounts (around 0.026%)
5. Hydrogen Deuteride (HD) Trace amounts (smaller than 0.002%)

Jupiter's massive size and strong gravitational influence make it an anomaly among the planets, with a composition that more closely resembles a star than a rocky planet. The high percentage of hydrogen and helium contributes to its distinctive appearance and powerful magnetic field.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on specific regions within Jupiter's atmosphere.
