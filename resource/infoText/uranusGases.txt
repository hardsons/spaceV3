Uranus' atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases. As one of the gas giants in our solar system, Uranus' atmospheric composition is distinct from that of terrestrial planets like Earth. Here's an approximate breakdown of the percentages of the main gases in Uranus' atmosphere:

1. Hydrogen (H2): Approximately 83%
2. Helium (He): Approximately 15%
3. Methane (CH4): Trace amounts (around 2.3%)
4. Hydrogen Deuteride (HD): Trace amounts (smaller than 0.002%)

Uranus' characteristic blue-green color is primarily attributed to the presence of methane gas, which absorbs red light and reflects blue and green light. The high percentages of hydrogen and helium, along with the trace amounts of other gases, contribute to Uranus' unique features and atmospheric dynamics.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on specific regions within Uranus' atmosphere.
