Saturn's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases. As another gas giant in our solar system, Saturn's atmospheric composition is distinct from that of terrestrial planets like Earth. Here's an approximate breakdown of the percentages of the main gases in Saturn's atmosphere:

1. Hydrogen (H2): Approximately 96%
2. Helium (He): Approximately 3%
3. Methane (CH4): Trace amounts (around 0.02%)
4. Ammonia (NH3): Trace amounts (smaller than 0.01%)

Saturn's high percentage of hydrogen, along with helium, contributes to its immense size and distinctive appearance. The trace amounts of methane and ammonia also play a role in Saturn's atmospheric chemistry and cloud formations.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on specific regions within Saturn's atmosphere.
