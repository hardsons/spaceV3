Mars has a thin atmosphere compared to Earth, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with trace amounts of other gases. Here's a rough approximation of the percentages of the main gases in Mars' atmosphere:

1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Approximately 95.3%
2. Nitrogen (N2): Approximately 2.7%
3. Argon (Ar): Approximately 1.6%
4. Oxygen (O2): Trace amounts (around 0.13%)

Mars' atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, with a surface pressure less than 1% of Earth's. The predominantly carbon dioxide composition and low pressure make the Martian atmosphere quite different from that of Earth.

Please note that these percentages are approximate and can vary slightly based on location and altitude within Mars' atmosphere.
